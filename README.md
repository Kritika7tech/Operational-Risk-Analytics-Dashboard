# Operational Risk Analytics Dashboard  
*Interactive Power BI solution for monitoring workforce automation exposure and other operational risk indicators*

## Description  
This dashboard provides a consolidated view of how AI-driven automation is reshaping job risk across industries and geographies. By combining detailed job-market data with operational risk management best practices, it allows stakeholders to track Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), spot emerging hotspots, and drive data-informed workforce planning.

## Project Overview  
- **Objective:** Equip risk managers, HR leaders, and L&D teams with a real-time, interactive tool to identify and mitigate automation-related risks in the workforce.  
- **Data Sources:** Structured table containing fields such as AI adoption level, automation risk counts & percentages (low/medium/high), company size, industry, job growth projections, location, remote-friendly flag, required skills, risk score, salary, and total job count.  
- **Audience:** Operational Risk Analysts, Talent Development Managers, Business Unit Heads, and Executive Sponsors.

## Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)  
1. **High Automation-Risk Count**  
   - Absolute number of roles vulnerable to automation within each industry or region.  
2. **High Automation-Risk Percentage**  
   - Proportion of total jobs at high risk—triggers threshold alerts when it exceeds preset limits.  
3. **Medium & Low Risk Distributions**  
   - Breakdown of roles by medium and low automation risk to balance mitigation efforts.  
4. **Job Growth vs. Risk Alignment**  
   - Comparison of projected job growth against risk exposure to highlight opportunity-risk mismatches.  
5. **Geographic Risk Hotspots**  
   - Identification of locations with concentrated high-risk roles for targeted interventions.  
6. **Remote-Friendly Resilience**  
   - Analysis of how remote-friendly roles correlate with lower automation risk scores.

## Dashboard Visuals  
- **Bar Chart:** Industries vs. High Automation-Risk Count, color-coded by company size  
- **Pie Chart:** Overall distribution of jobs across Low, Medium, and High automation-risk tiers  
- **Heatmap (Matrix):** Locations × Industries colored by High Automation-Risk Count  
- **Line Chart:** Industry-level Job Growth Projection vs. High Automation-Risk Percentage  
 

Each visual cross-filters the others, enabling drill-downs and rapid identification of critical risk areas.

## Interactivity & Alerts  
  
- **Custom Tooltips:** Hover to reveal job titles, required skills, average salary, and detailed risk scores.  
- **Reference Lines & Conditional Formatting:** Visual thresholds that immediately flag metrics above acceptable risk levels.  
- **Scheduled Data Refresh:** Automated updates ensure KRIs remain current, with configurable refresh cadence.

## Recommendations & Next Steps  
- **Targeted Reskilling:** Prioritize Manufacturing & Transportation hubs with the highest automation-risk concentrations.  
- **Growth-Aligned Training:** Invest in AI and digital skills for industries showing strong growth projections but medium-risk exposure (e.g., Software, Healthcare).  
- **Remote Work Expansion:** Increase remote-friendly roles to enhance workforce resilience.  
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Establish quarterly reviews and threshold-based alerts to adapt strategies as AI adoption evolves.
